# Idea
For the euler account as a token issuer, he/she enables supply-sovereign amm constrained to a specific time epoch and/or funds raised and after that starts a regular price discovery

the idea is to define dynamic swap fees appropriate for each epoch, fund raising and price discovery

## Mechanism Design

- How to adapt the curvature params appropiatley for supplySovering AMM?

- What are the optimal fees when considering supplySovereing AMM?

- How the behaviour of dyanmic fees evolves when transfering to price discovery ?
